# MPL-Jeopardy-Rd3
The frontend implementation of Jeopardy played in Round 3 along with instructions and readmes for each section

Each section within the file has a readme, it involves general rules for that section which is about how to play the game, special powers and the description. It is followed by a tech stuff label. This is for the tech team who can use these notes to understand which page has which features and additional comments.

All codes are commented and CSS file follwos a pattern mentioned in ReadMe.

Disclaimer: The code will not run on github pages as it uses relative addressing. The images and audios will mess up. To run the code, clone the repo to local system (or fork it) and use the VSCode live server extension (by Ritwick Dey). To make the images, audios and links work on a regular double click rather than a live server, change all relative addresses to absolute addresses.
